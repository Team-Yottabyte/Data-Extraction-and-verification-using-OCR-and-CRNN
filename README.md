# Data-Extraction-and-verification-using-OCR-and-CRNN
As per the requirements,We have tried to use CRNN(Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) to enhance the quality of the image by training it.
The trained model is saved as "crnn_model.h5"
This trained model now acts as a input for tesseract(An OCR System) for text extraction from the filtered images.
Technologies Used :
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CRNN model.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
Tesseract OCR: To extract text from enhanced images.
Python: Main programming language.
